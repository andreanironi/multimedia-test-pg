The reference value is called ‘safe’ because it takes account of the evidence describing the relationship between sodium intake and CVD risk in the general population and ‘adequate’ in line with the definition of an Adequate Intake. 
The value provides guidance on a level of sodium intake compatible with good health that can inform population goals for sodium. However, the value has limited utility for assessing and planning the diet of individuals. At the individual level, if the usual intake of sodium exceeds this value, it could be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including concurring risk factors such as primary hypertension.","https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2903/j.efsa.2019.5778","NA",,"NA",,,,"NA",,"NA",,2019,"EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies (NDA)","Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for sodium","10.2903/j.efsa.2019.5778","NOT AVAILABLE YET","NA","NA",,"NA",,"NA","NA","NA",

For adults, ARs for energy are calculated by multiplying estimates of resting energy expenditure (REE), predicted from anthropometric measures, with PAL values. ARs for energy were not calculated for adults ≥ 80 years because of a lack of anthropometric data from EU countries for this age group.

For pregnant and lactating women value should be added to the AR of non-pregnant, non-lactating women.
